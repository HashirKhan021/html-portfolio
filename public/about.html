<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I am a web developer who loves the intricacy of the art of giving life to the ideas. 
  The journey to web development started from my interest in the way a digital sphere can convert 
  intangible thoughts into real, interactive adventures.</p>

<p>I prosper by brainstormingâ€”contributing a mere thought and ultimate shaping it into a fully realized 
  presence on the Internet. This act of translation process between human thoughts and virtual reality is 
  what keeps me motivated every day.</p>

<p>Having mastered the foundation of Html , I've been part of various projects that reflect my commitment in creating sites that are simple, fast, and user-oriented. 
  In most cases, I'm the constructor of either a smart portfolio for a creative professional or an animated web application, 
  but the core idea is always the same: I assist you to realize your concepts in the way that has most impact on the users.</p>
